    <h1>Happy Birthday, My Fadil !! ðŸ¥³</h1>
    <p class="intro">
    Baby, I made this little corner of the internet just for you â€” because you deserve to be celebrated in the most special way. Youâ€™ve brought light into my life in ways I canâ€™t fully explain. From your calming presence to the way you encourage me, protect me, and love me with so much ease â€” youâ€™ve shown me what peace and true partnership look like. You make me feel safe, seen, and deeply appreciated. Every laugh, every ride, every random gist, every late-night chat, and every quiet moment with you has become something I want to hold on to forever. This page is filled with pieces of our love â€” the beautiful memories weâ€™ve made and the unspoken prayers I whisper for you every day. May Allah bless you, always protect your heart, and make the rest of your life even more beautiful than you imagine. Thank you for choosing me. Iâ€™ll always be proud to call you mine.
</p>
